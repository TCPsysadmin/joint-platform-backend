"""Resumable chunked-upload session management.

Lets a browser upload a large media file in small slices that can be retried or
resumed independently, instead of one giant multipart POST that a proxy can time
out. Each session writes to a single `.part` file on disk; on completion the file
is handed off to the existing local-file transcription job path.

State is held in memory (mirroring JobManager). Sessions do not survive a process
restart — orphaned `.part` files are cleared on boot by main.py's lifespan.
